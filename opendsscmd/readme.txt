opendsscmd version 1.7.3
========================

This is a 64-bit command-line version of the simulator for Windows, Linux and Mac OSX operating systems. It is model-compatible with version 9 of the Windows-only version. The major differences between opendsscmd and Windows-only OpenDSS are:

1 - There is no support for Windows COM automation, and no separate DLL version. (Use FNCS or HELICS instead)

2 - There is no graphical user interface (GUI) or plotting. (Use MATLAB or Python instead)

3 - Automation is provided through the Framework for Network Cosimulation (FNCS) library developed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), and the HELICS framework developed by several US Department of Energy labs under the Grid Modernization Laboratory Consortium (GMLC) project 1.4.15.

4 - It is built with Free Pascal instead of Delphi.

Installation
============

On Linux and Mac OSX, the files will be installed as follows (no user choice at this time):

  Executables:     /usr/local/bin
  Libraries:       /usr/local/lib
  Docs:            /usr/local/share/opendsscmd/doc
  Tech Notes:      /usr/local/share/opendsscmd/doc/notes
  Test Files:      /usr/local/share/opendsscmd/test
  EPRI Test Cases: /usr/local/share/opendsscmd/examples/epri
  IEEE Test Cases: /usr/local/share/opendsscmd/examples/ieee

On Windows, the files will be installed as follows, and c:\opendsscmd is appended to the system path 
(the user can change c:\opendsscmd):

  Executables:     c:\opendsscmd
  Libraries:       c:\opendsscmd
  Docs:            c:\opendsscmd\doc
  Tech Notes:      c:\opendsscmd\doc\notes
  Test Files:      c:\opendsscmd\test
  EPRI Test Cases: c:\opendsscmd\examples\epri
  IEEE Test Cases: c:\opendsscmd\examples\ieee

On all platforms, an uninstaller is provided one level above the Docs directory.

FNCS and HELICS
===============

On all platforms, FNCS and HELICS will be installed or updated (no user choice at this time).

On Windows, the communication libraries ZeroMQ and CZMQ are also installed to support FNCS
and HELICS. These local copies won't interfere with other software on the computer.

On Linux or Mac OS X, you may have to install ZeroMQ and CZMQ yourself, following examples
provided below. Without those libraries, you may see "FNCS not available" and/or
"HELICS not available" from the opendsscmd prompt, but in all other respects the program is 
fully functional.

To install the support libraries on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS:

  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get -y install libzmq5-dev
  sudo apt-get -y install libczmq-dev

To install the support libraries on Centos 8:

  sudo dnf update -y
  sudo dnf install zeromq-devel -y
  sudo dnf install czmq-devel -y

To install the support libraries on Mac OS X:

  xcode-select --install
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
  brew install zmq
  brew install czmq

Quick Start
===========

If you're unfamiliar with OpenDSS, the Doc files OpenDSSPrimer.pdf and OpenDSSManual.pdf to learn about its modeling and analysis features.  However, none of the COM automation or plotting features are supported in opendsscmd. To run any of the non-graphical commands:

1. Enter "opendsscmd" from a command prompt
    a. The program's >> prompt will appear. Enter any OpenDSS command(s) from this prompt
    b. Up and down arrows navigate through the command history
    c. Enter "help" from the >> prompt for the built-in help
    d. Enter "exit", "q" or an empty line from >> to exit
2. You can enter "opendsscmd filename.dss" from a command prompt. This runs the OpenDSS commands in filename.dss, and then exits immediately.
3. You can enter "opendsscmd –f" from a command prompt; this enters a FNCS time step loop.
4. You can enter "opendsscmd –f filename.dss" from a command prompt. This runs the OpenDSS commands in filename.dss, and then enters a FNCS time step loop.
5. Enter "opendsscmd -h" from a command prompt to show the command line options, which include three logging levels for FNCS messages

To verify proper installation:

1. Navigate to the test directory
   a. On Windows, "cd c:\opendsscmd\test"
   b. On Linux or Mac OS X:
      i.   "mkdir work"
      ii.  "cp -r /usr/local/share/opendsscmd/* work"
      iii. "cd work/test"
1. From the test directory, invoke "opendsscmd", and then "redirect IEEE13Nodeckt.dss". A list of solved node voltages should appear in your system's default test editor. Enter "quit" to leave opendsscmd
2. From the test directory, invoke "opendsscmd export_test.dss". This should create a Common Information Model (CIM) export of the IEEE 13-bus feeder.
3. If you have FNCS installed, from install_dir/test invoke "test_fncs.bat" (on Windows) or "./test_fncs.sh" (on Linux or Mac OSX). This will play some basic commands to opendsscmd over FNCS on port 5570, and then exit. If something goes wrong here:
   a. To list processes using port 5570, use "list5570.bat" on Windows or "lsof -i tcp:5570" on Linux/Mac
   b. To kill all processes using port 5570, use "kill5570.bat" on Windows or "kill5570.sh" on Linux/Mac

Open Issues
===========

1. The regular expressions for the batchedit command, which are implemented in ExecHelper.pas, have become case-sensitive.  They need to be made case-insensitive.
2. On Windows, the command history editor is "sluggish". You have to type slowly.

Source Code
===========

OpenDSS source code is available from the following SVN repository: 

http://svn.code.sf.net/p/electricdss/code/trunk/

The opendsscmd version requires Lazarus/Free Pascal to build. Some of the supporting modules may require a C++ compiler to build from source. See the Doc file OpenDSS_FPC_Build.pdf for directions.
