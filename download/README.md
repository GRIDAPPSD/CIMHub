## CIMHub Release

Three downloadable files constitute a CIMHub release:

1. ```cimhub-#.#.#.jar``` is a Java program with dependencies
2. ```tutorial.zip``` contains input files for the tutorial
3. ```queries.zip``` contains example SPARQL queries and Blazegraph configurations

You will need the Blazegraph database engine and cimhub Python module to use these files.
